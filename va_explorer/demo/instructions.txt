Steps to get ODK Central docker containers working:
	# clone central repo
	git clone https://github.com/getodk/central
	# download submodules in central repo
	git submodule update -i
	# change .env file to use these settings:
		SSL_TYPE=selfsign
		DOMAIN=local
		SYSADMIN_EMAIL=administrator@email.com
		NOTE: Can only open the application in firefox
	# had to comment out following line in service.dockerfile:
	echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ stretch-pgdg main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list;
	# had to change mount directory of nginx from data/tr... to /Volume/data/tr... in docker-compose.yml
	# build containers and run
	docker-compose build; docker-compose up -d
	
Steps to create odk central project
	# create admin account:	
         docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email admin@example.com user-create
	docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email admin@example.com user-promote
	# log into gui (should be accesible at https://localhost)
	# create new project (keep track of the project name. I called it zambia-test)
	# upload VA form (I used WHO 2016 - ignored the warning the system throws)
        # publish draft
